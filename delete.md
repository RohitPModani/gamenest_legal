## 🗑️ Methods to Delete Your Data

### Method 2: Clear Individual Game Statistics

Some games have built-in options to reset their specific statistics without affecting other games.

#### Board Games (AI Statistics)
For games like **Tic Tac Toe**, **Connect 4**, **Checkers**, **Reversi**, **Mancala**, **Dots & Boxes**, and **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**:

1. Open the game from the hub screen
2. Look for a **"Statistics"** or **"Reset Stats"** button on the home screen
3. Tap the reset option
4. Confirm the action

This will clear only that game's win/loss/draw records.

#### Other Games
Most games don't have individual reset buttons. To clear their data, use Method 1 (Reset All Statistics) or Method 4 (Clear All App Data).

3. Tap it to un-favorite the game

Alternatively:

**Note**: This only removes games from your favorites list. It does not delete game statistics or progress.
